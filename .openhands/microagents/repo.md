# Gita Tools Repository

## Repository Type
This is a **mono repository** that contains more than one project.

## Overview
The `gita-tools` repository is structured as a monorepo to house multiple related projects that work with or are inspired by the Bhagavad Gita. This organizational approach allows for:

- Shared dependencies and tooling across projects
- Consistent development practices
- Easier maintenance and coordination between related tools
- Centralized documentation and issue tracking

## Projects
This monorepo contains multiple projects related to Gita tools and utilities. Each project may have its own specific purpose, dependencies, and documentation within their respective directories.

## Structure
As a monorepo, this repository is organized to support multiple independent but related projects under a single version control system, facilitating better collaboration and resource sharing.
